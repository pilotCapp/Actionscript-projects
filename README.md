# Project Descriptions

## How to open
.fla files are tricky to open and I have only managed to do so in adobe animate. However I have uploaded some swf files which I can open in finder(not in vscode), so you might have to download them. 

## Reasoning
As these side projects are some of my first and most simple projects during my senior year in high school, they do convey a lot about how I approach problem solving and how I work with programming. Therefore I do think they represent me quite well. 

### drawingFerdig
A simple drawing program that used mouse events and circles of different color and size to create a drawing program. I imported a picture of a colorwheel and used this to create my own color selection, and the result was a pretty good drawing program. Additionally I wanted to create a figure detection algorithm so I utilized my math knowlege to create corners whenever the gradient changed by a certain amount, and the result was a pretty bad but working figure detection algorithm.

### game1
My first game, its quite fun, you can save up to a lamborgini but it didnt really have an end , unless you find the hidden portal... 
What I remember best about it was when I figured out where the figure should be oriented, do you see how?

### gunGame
I have always been facinated with 3D objects, and this was my first attempt at a 3D game, I remember sitting in my room at our mountaincabin without internet, creating this game, good memories. It worked by having a pretty cool gun I designed in the middle, and using the position of the mouse to configure where the fun pointed and the width, creating a 3d illusion. This looked kinda whack but it worked. When you pressed the mouse the gun would shoot a bullet with a velocity in x,y,z direction relative to the gun position, and the objective was to hit rick and morty figures on the x,z axis. A fun game.

### rootFerdig
I have allways been facinated with AI and I wanted to create one. Of course I had no idea how and what an AI even was, so the result was a root algorithm. It worked by having a seed which would create roots downwards. In the ground there would be water droplets, and the current root would know how far away the droplets were. It would then move in a random direction and if the distance grew it would backpropogate and redo. It would do this until all droplets had been aquired. Looking back this was actually a really cool algorithm because three years later I would learn about recurring funcitons and backpropogation, which I then just intuitivly had assimilated.

### CUBE_3D
My most proud achievement. In order to create a better 3D game I wanted to create a 3D game engine so to speak. I had no idea how, and I refused to use the internet to find solutions, because I wanted to find one myself. So over the course of a month I had multiple attempts at creating a 3D rendered world on my 2D computer screen. One day while I was working as an extra for a tv-show, I had some time for myself. I decided to use this to figure out how to do it so without my computer I sat beneath some stairs just thinking, and then it came to me. I had to again use knowlege from my math class, creating two circles using sigmoid functions and boom, I had a cube. By scaling this cube, and changing the gradient I could see myself in a square room. This was extremely cool, but unfortunately I never got to use this for a game. Nonetheless the takeaway here is just how far you can come with persistance and math knowlege.

### K_LOGO
I wanted to utilize some of my projects to get a better grade in my class. Therefore I wanted to create a rotating 3D logo with K for Kristoffer. By using the code from the CUBE, and importing it into all of my deliverables including my exam, I think it impressed my teacher. Looking back this is a pretty good example of how I utilized object oriented programming, without even knowing about it.

## note
Im sorry if this seemed unnecessary and boasting, that was not my intention. I just wanted to use these projects to explain a bit about myself, as they have taught me a lot and I have not been able to use them for anything else.
